# Prompt Design for Generative AI with Vertex AI

This repository contains my notes, code snippets, and examples from the Google Cloud course: **Prompt Design in Generative AI with Vertex AI**.

## 📌 Course Overview
This course teaches how to:
- Understand and apply prompt design principles
- Use large language models (LLMs) effectively
- Build and optimize prompts for specific tasks
- Deploy GenAI models using Google Cloud's Vertex AI

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered
- Prompt tuning and chaining
- Types of prompts (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, etc.)
- Safety and ethics in prompt engineering
- Using the PaLM and Gemini APIs on Vertex AI
- Model evaluation and iteration

## 🧪 What You'll Find in This Repo
- 📂 /notebooks: Sample Colab/Jupyter notebooks with prompt examples
- 📄 /notes: Summary of key points and terminology
- 🛠️ /vertex-ai-demos: Simple use cases deployed on Vertex AI (e.g., sentiment analysis, text summarization)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

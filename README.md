# Generative-AI-with-Vertex-AI-Prompt-Design
This repository explores prompt engineering techniques using Vertex AI. It covers best practices for structuring prompts, including zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning approaches. You'll find examples demonstrating text generation use cases such as ideation, Q&amp;A, text classification, extraction, and summarization.
Great! You're combining two important AI concepts: **how LLMs work (especially transformers)** and **how to prompt them effectively** (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot). Here's how they fit together and how you can explain or use them in your projects, chatbot, or cloud-based applications:

### 🔍 **LLMs + Prompting Techniques in Real-World Use**

| **Component**           | **Role**                                                                             | **Example**                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM (e.g., ChatGPT)** | Core model that understands and generates human-like text using transformer networks | Powering a chatbot, summarizer, PDF analyzer         |
| **Zero-Shot Prompting** | No example given; model relies entirely on pretraining                               | "Summarize this article."                            |
| **One-Shot Prompting**  | One example to show expected format                                                  | "Summarize the article like this: \[example]"        |
| **Few-Shot Prompting**  | Two or more examples; helps with structure and tone                                  | "Summarize the following like the 3 examples above." |

**Technique Used:**
✅ *Few-shot prompting* works best here because the structure of PDF text can vary, and you often want structured output like summaries, lists, or extracted data.

### 💡 Summary

| **Use Case**                        | **Recommended Prompting**               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Simple chatbot Q\&A                 | Zero-shot or One-shot                   |
| Tone-specific or structured chatbot | Few-shot                                |
| PDF summarizer or analyzer          | Few-shot (for reliable structure)       |
| Coding assistants                   | Few-shot (to maintain logic and syntax) |
